The Beavers have played at the site of Goss Stadium since the program began play more than 100 years ago. Goss Stadium at Coleman Field is nestled into the heart of the Oregon State campus, and seats about 3,315 fans. Approximately 2,800 seats are situated in foul territory, with another 500 located in right field. The stadium has undergone numerous expansions and renovations.

                <h2>OSU Softball Complex</h2>
                <p>The Oregon State Softball Complex opened in April 2001 and since then the Beavers have won over 60 percent of their games at home, including amassing nearly 50 wins over nationally ranked opponents. Starting in the 2019 season, the OSU Softball Complex will feature field lights, allowing the Beavers to play home games at night. The complex features 750 bleacher backed seats, a concession and restroom facility, as well as one of the top playing surfaces in the nation. The sunken dugouts each contain a restroom for players as well as large storage areas. The closed press box facility allows ample seating for six scorers in the main booth with two smaller television and radio booths located on both sides. A state-of-the-art sound and public address system are also housed in the press box.</p>

                <h2>Paul Lorenz Field at Patrick Wayne Valley Stadium</h2>
                <p>Opened in the fall of 1996 a block southeast of Reser Stadium, Patrick Wayne Valley Stadium seats 1,500 fans and has an enclosed press box on the west sideline and covered team benches on the east sideline. Lights were installed prior to the 2006 season adding to the programs' allure and giving fans the opportunity to enjoy night games. The stadium is named for the late Patrick Wayne Valley, who was an Oregon State football letterman and 1964 Rose Bowl team member. The field is named for Paul Lorenz, who is the former owner of L&H Grading in Salem and provided equipment for the construction of the original surface.</p>

                <h2>Reser Stadium</h2>
                <p>Home of the Oregon State University football team since 1953, Reser Stadium has been a fixture on the University’s south campus for numerous athletic events, graduation ceremonies, concerts and a wide array of other athletic and non-athletic events. The stadium, which is located on the south side of campus, was originally built in 1953 with a seating capacity of 28,000. Following the 1965 Rose Bowl, additional end zone bleacher seats were added to raise the capacity to 33,000. The stadium was expanded to 40,593 in 1967 with a new addition to the west side, including a new press box. Stadium capacity was reduced in 1990 as a result of the construction of the original Valley Football Center, which was recently upgraded in 2017. The stadium’s capacity is now 43,363.</p>

                <h2>Whyte Track and Field Center</h2>
                <p>The Whyte Track and Field Center opened in Sept. 2012. The ribbon-cutting ceremony represented a milestone in the rebirth of the OSU track and field program. The program continues to grow after it was officially reintroduced to OSU Athletics in September 2004, following an 18-year hiatus. The facility features an Olympic caliber polyurethane surface, a FieldTurf infield, a nine-lane track, high jump aprons, long jump, triple jump, pole vault and javelin runways, shot put sectors, and dual discus rings. Future upgrades to the Whyte Track and Field Center include the installation of grandstands, a press box, a scoreboard, and other amenities.</p>

                        relies on both leaflet and Boostrap.</p>
