                <h2>Paul Lorenz Field at Patrick Wayne Valley Stadium</h2>
                <p>Opened in the fall of 1996 a block southeast of Reser Stadium, Patrick Wayne Valley Stadium seats 1,500 fans and has an enclosed press box on the west sideline and covered team benches on the east sideline. Lights were installed prior to the 2006 season adding to the programs' allure and giving fans the opportunity to enjoy night games.

The field is named for Paul Lorenz, who is the former owner of L&H Grading in Salem and provided equipment for the construction of the original surface.</p>

The stadium was expanded to 40,593 in 1967 with a new addition to the west side, including a new press box.
