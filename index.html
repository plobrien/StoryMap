                <h2>Gill Coliseum</h2>
                <p>Portland is a seaport and the largest city in the U.S. state of Oregon and the seat of Multnomah
                    County. It is in the Willamette Valley region of the Pacific Northwest, at the confluence of the
                    Willamette and Columbia Rivers. The city covers 145 square miles (380 square kilometers) and had an
                    estimated population of 632,309 in 2015, making it the 26th most populous city in the United States.
                    Approximately 2,389,228 people live in the Portland metropolitan statistical area (MSA), the 23rd
                    most populous MSA in the United States. Its Combined Statistical Area (CSA) ranks 17th with a
                    population of 3,022,178. Roughly 60% of Oregon's population resides within the Portland metropolitan
                    area.</p>
                <p>Named after Portland, Maine, the Oregon settlement began to be populated in the 1830s near the end of
                    the Oregon Trail. Its water access provided convenient transportation of goods, and the timber
                    industry was a major force in the city's early economy. At the turn of the 20th century, the city
                    had a reputation as one of the most dangerous port cities in the world, a hub for organized crime
                    and racketeering.</p>
                <p>After the city's economy experienced an industrial boom during World War II, its hard-edged
                    reputation began to dissipate. Beginning in the 1960s, Portland became noted for its growing liberal
                    political values, and the city has earned a reputation as a bastion of counterculture, which
                    proceeded into the 21st century. According to a 2009 Pew Research Center study, Portland ranks as
                    the eighth most popular American city, based on where people want to live. </p>

                <h2>Goss Stadium at Coleman Field</h2>
                <p>Corvallis is a city in central western Oregon, United States. It is the county seat of Benton County
                    and the principal city of the Corvallis, Oregon Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses all
                    of Benton County. As of the 2010 United States Census, the population was 54,462. Its population was
                    estimated by the Portland Research Center to be 55,298 in 2013.Corvallis is the location of Oregon
                    State University, a large Hewlett-Packard research campus, and Good Samaritan Regional Medical
                    Center.</p>
                <p>In October 1845, Joseph C. Avery arrived in Oregon from the east. Avery took out a land claim at the
                    mouth of Marys River where it flows into the Willamette River and in June 1846 took up residence
                    there in a log cabin hastily constructed to hold what seemed a potentially lucrative claim. Avery's
                    primitive 1846 dwelling was the first home within the boundaries of today's Corvallis and his land
                    claim included the southern section of the contemporary city.</p>
                <p>Corvallis is the largest principal city of the Albany-Corvallis-Lebanon CSA, a Combined Statistical
                    Area that includes the Corvallis metropolitan area (Benton County) and the Albany-Lebanon
                    micropolitan area (Linn County),which had a combined population of 202,251 at the 2010 U.S. Census.
                    As of the 2000 U.S. Census the median income for a household in the city was $35,437, and the median
                    income for a family was $53,208. Males had a median income of $40,770 versus $29,390 for females.
                    The per capita income for the city was $19,317. About 9.7% of families and 20.6% of the population
                    were below the poverty line, including 15.2% of those under age 18 and 6.0% of those age 65 or
                    over.</p>

                <h2>OSU Softball Complex</h2>
                <p>The Oregon State Softball Complex opened in April 2001 and since then the Beavers have won over 60 percent of their games at home, including amassing nearly 50 wins over nationally ranked opponents. Starting in the 2019 season, the OSU Softball Complex will feature field lights, allowing the Beavers to play home games at night. The complex features 750 bleacher backed seats, a concession and restroom facility, as well as one of the top playing surfaces in the nation. The sunken dugouts each contain a restroom for players as well as large storage areas. The closed press box facility allows ample seating for six scorers in the main booth with two smaller television and radio booths located on both sides. A state-of-the-art sound and public address system are also housed in the press box.</p>

                <h2>Paul Lorenz Field at Patrick Wayne Valley Stadium</h2>
                <p>Opened in the fall of 1996 a block southeast of Reser Stadium, Patrick Wayne Valley Stadium seats 1,500 fans and has an enclosed press box on the west sideline and covered team benches on the east sideline. Lights were installed prior to the 2006 season adding to the programs' allure and giving fans the opportunity to enjoy night games. The stadium is named for the late Patrick Wayne Valley, who was an Oregon State football letterman and 1964 Rose Bowl team member. The field is named for Paul Lorenz, who is the former owner of L&H Grading in Salem and provided equipment for the construction of the original surface.</p>

                <h2>Trysting Tree Golf Club</h2>
                <p>Since it opened in the summer of 1988, the spacious Trysting Tree Golf Club, located just five minutes from the Oregon State campus, has been the home of the Beavers' men's and women's golf programs. Trysting Tree Golf Club is a versatile golf course varying in lengths from 5,500-7,000 yards and carries a par 72. Oregon State coaches and student-athletes enjoy the luxury of the program's own three-hole, par-3 golf course and their own covered end of the driving range and short-game practice area.</p>

                <h2>Whyte Track and Field Center</h2>
                <p>Oregon was inhabited by many indigenous tribes before Western traders, explorers, and settlers
                    arrived. An autonomous government was formed in the Oregon Country in 1843 before the Oregon
                    Territory was created in 1848. Oregon became the 33rd state on February 14, 1859. Today, at 98,000
                    square miles (255,000 km²), Oregon is the ninth largest and, with a population of 4 million, 27th
                    most populous U.S. state. The capital of Oregon is Salem, the second most populous of its cities,
                    with 164,549 residents. Portland is Oregon's most populous city, with 632,309 residents, and ranks
                    as the 26th most populous city in the United States. Portland's metro population of 2,389,228 ranks
                    the 23rd largest metro in the nation. The Willamette Valley in western Oregon is the state's most
                    densely populated area, home to eight of the ten most.</p>
