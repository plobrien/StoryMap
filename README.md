# Oregon State Athletics Facilities Story Map
https://plobrien.github.io/StoryMap/
This story map shows Oregon State University's athletic facilities that are used for competion. Oregon State has other athletic facilties, but those are strictly used for training and pratice. The facilities in this story map are where you can go to watch an Oregon State athletic team compete. The story map consists of seven slides, including the cover and end pages, that give you an overview of the facilites and include a brief paragraph about the facility, it's history, and who plays there. I wasn't able to figure out how to include photos in the text box without having the photo be way too big. I also wanted to include a marker to more easliy identitify what facility is being looked at, as some are right next to each other or kind of small. Go Beavs!
